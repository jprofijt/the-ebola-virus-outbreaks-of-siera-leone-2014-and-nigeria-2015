# Abstract

Since traveling is a lot easier than 50 jears ago, we travel a lot more. Globalisation is not a bad thing but it comes with a huge risk, the risk of easily spreading infection deseases. Ebola virus disease (EVD) is one of these infection deseases. On 20 july, 2014 a infected passenger landed in Nigeria and started a outbreak. This outbreak was a pretty small one of only 20 cases, this was because of the quick respons of only 3 days. Showing how important it is to react quickly to an infection. In this paper we tried to match an EVD model to the outbreaks of Nigeria 2015 and Sierra Leone 2014 to show the value of a quick reaction.

# 1. Introduction


In this day and age the world is getting smaller and smaller. To get from europe to the united states it roughly takes 11 hours. This ease of travelling everywhere in the world within one day comes with one huge risk, the risk of spreading a dangerous infectious disease. On july 20, 2014 a infected passenger, with the Ebola virus disease (EVD), arrived in Nigeria. After a total of 20 cases where 8 died, Nigeria was cleared of the ebola virus on october 20, 2014 57 days. This shows what happens if 1 person is infected with ebola and begins to get in contact with others. Luckely by handeling fast not many people got infected with EVD because the authorities handeled quickly. Through our simulations we are trying to replicate the outbreak in Nigeria and see what can happen if there wasn't a quick response and we like to show if this outbreak was a abnormlity or simular to other outbreaks. Also we would like to compare the outbreak in Nigeria with other simular type of outbreaks and see if our parameters in the model are accurate for other EVD cases. The model was used before in the same sort of experiment that we are trying to replicate. Altough in the experiment before the research didn't go further into other outbreaks.

# 2. Materials & Methods

## 2.1. The Model

![schematic model for EVD infection spread. Susceptible induviduals *S* are infected by infectious individuals *I* at rate $\beta$. Then they go through a incubation period *E* at rate   $\sigma$. After incubation induviduals become infectious *I*. These infectious people either recover *R* or die *D* at rate $\gamma$. The fatality rate so how many people die or recover is given by *f*.](EVD_Model.png)


The model uses the following formula's:

* $B(t) = B0e^{(-k(time - t))}$
* $dS/dT = -B(t)SI$
* $dE/dT = B(t)SI - \sigma E$
* $dI/dT = \sigma E - yI$
* $dR/dT = (1-f)yI$
* $dD/dT = fyI$

The model itself is a rather simple SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infecious-Recovered) model, as can be seen in figure 2. The people that are in the group of susceptible people *S* will move to the exposed group *E* after they get infected by the virus, if they are exposed to the virus they will go through a incubation period $\sigma$. After they went through the incubation period they will move to the infected group *I*. Here they will move trough the infectiousness period *y*. After this they will either move to the group recoverd people *R* or the group dead people *D*. This will be caculated by using the fatality rate *f*, in the case of ebola it is 0.39. The differential equations will be solved using the $ODE()$ function from deSolve, deSolve is a package in R. [1]


## 2.2. The data

The model was started with 10^6^ susceptible people *S*, 1 infected person *I* and no people that where exposed to him *E*. This was done because the case that was simulated was with one index case that could be traced. We also started with 0 dead people *D* and 0 recovered people R* because there cant be any dead people if there was nobody infected before the first day, this also goes for the recovered people. In the table below you can see the initial values of the model. [1]

Figure 11: Model compaired to other outbreak.

This plot shows the Simulation of the Sierra Leone outbreak, with the cases of the Sierra Leone outbreak next to it. The blue line in this plot is the optimisation done with the $optim()$ function with the Nelder-Mead method. For this simulation was the transmission decay set to 0.011 and the time when the controlmeasures where implemented was at day 200 as can be seen in the table 4. The amount of sucseptible people was set to 163675 and we didn't change the amount of infected people at day 0. This can been seen in table 4 [4, 5]

# 4. Discussion

In the last graph the "k" variable, which stands for the rate that the transmission speed is decreased, is drasticly diffrent from our original asumptions as it was 0.19 and now 0.011. This was done because otherwise the simulation was drasticly diffrent from the outbreak data. A explaination could be that there was no real strutured combatting of the infection spread in Sierra Leaone. Also the time that measures were implementet were also changed from 3 to 200 days, this could just be that the outbreak wasn't detectet for a long time or just no measures were implementet. 

Discussie:
laat in het onderzoek kwam de fouten, optim(), review verslag was af en toe moeilijk te begrijpen, parameters, toekomst plan: andere data nemen (andere landen, andere tijden)

The model has some limitations. Firstly we cant predict if a infected induvidual is maby very outgoing and infecting lots or if that person isolates himself or gets isolated. Second we fitted our first simulations upon a very small outbreak of only 20 cases. Third we used the asumption that the infectiousness was equal over the whole period and not tat there could be variations. fourth the case location, as in hosptial settings and whatnot in those quarantine locations spread would be minimal.

In our simulations we had some problems with the r code, firstly we late in the making we found that there was something wrong with the transmission decline, as the decline didnt start at our given "t"  but is started imidtly which gave some weird results. Second in the paper we tried to replicate they used optim to fit the model to their data. We did try using optim but as seen by the blue line in the last graph figure: 11 it didn't really do what we expected. Third the outbreak data from the other experiment was not avalable anywhere anymore so we had to judgy py graph comparison and which parameters they used was also very unclear until the end.

What we'd like to experiment with further is more outbreaks in diffrent places and times to see the diffrences and see if the model still applies, So that at a later date with other outbreaks this model can be used for damage assesment.
